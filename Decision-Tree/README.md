# Decision-Tree-Model
Problem Description :-

The ministry observed that there are a lot of people who entered the country with a fake passport. Now, they want to verify at a large scale to get a rough estimate on who all could be having a fake passport. So, they planned to use the uploaded images of the passport to try to identify the fake ones. Imagine you're an ML consultant to the defence ministry of India. You're given a labeled dataset to identify the potentially fake passports from original ones. The dataset contains a few properties of the images like correlation of photo with person's photo, contrast, energy and inverse difference moment.
