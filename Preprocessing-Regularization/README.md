# Preprocessing-Regularization-in-Model
This model is using logistic regression with regularization for this classification problem as data contains few null values and is not preprocessed. So, I have shown how to regularize data and process further.  

Problem Description :-
Consider the case of Pune labs in India. As the number of cases of COVID-19 is rising day by day, the government decided to predict the number of cases that would be critical, so that they can provide more ventilators.

As an Al/ML expert, your task is to predict whether a person would get critical or not. You are provided with the data of the cases like age, sex, travelled place, immunity level, fever frequency, breathing difficulty level and blood sugar. Help the government predict the number of critical cases.
